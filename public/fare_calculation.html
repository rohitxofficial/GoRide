                <br>
                <p class="text-small">Algorithm charges a base fare of 100 Rs for Rides less than or equal to 5 Km and
                    above which the Driver can earn a fee of Rs 11 per Km excluding the Gas Price which will be added to
                    the fare. The fare is calculated to provide a better experience to both the Drivers and Users. Make
                    sure the Driver is earning a good amount for living, as well as making it affordable for a user. The
                    Base Fare is kept at 100 Rs considering the distance driver would have to travel to reach the
                    Pick-up Location.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-small">An extra fare will be added in the case of Toll-Tax.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-small">Suppose a ride of 20Km is assigned to a driver, the fare will be Rs 100 (Base Fare
                    of 5 Km) + Rs 165
                    (Drivers Profit for other 15 Km @ Rs 11 per Km) + CNG Price Rs 56 (Calculated @CNG Price of Rs 70
                    Per Kg and Car Mileage @25 Km Per Kg) which results in Total of Rs 321 which is comparatively better
                    than current Market Price for a similar distance as well as gives a much better return to Driver.
